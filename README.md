## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Maximilian Linhoff, an astrophysicist and scientific software engineer working in high energy gamma-ray astronomy.

Most of my work is focused on the [Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory](https://ctao.org), a new instrument currently being constructed.
Here, I work on the data processing and preservation pipeline and on calibration and analysis of the data of the first operating
telescope built for CTAO: the [Large-Sized Telescope 1](https://lst1.iac.es) on La Palma.
